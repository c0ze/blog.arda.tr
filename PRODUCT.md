## Platform

web

## Users

**Primary: peers and collaborators.** Engineers and makers who arrive from
GitHub (`c0ze`), Mastodon, Bluesky, `arda.tr`, or an RSS reader. They are here
to read something specific, not to browse a brand.

**Secondary: Arda himself.** The blog is the working log — the place a project
gets written down while it is still warm.

Not a recruiter surface (that is `resume.arda.tr`) and not a lead-generation
surface. No conversion funnel belongs here.

## Product Purpose

A personal blog, published since 2010, holding 86 posts. It is where the work
on `arda.tr` gets explained: how a thing was built, why it was abandoned, what
the interesting part was.

Success: a peer reads to the end of a post and comes back for the next one.

## Positioning

Sixteen years of one person's writing, with a visible seven-year silence in the
middle (2019–2024) and a heavy recent burst — 52 of 86 posts are from 2025–2026.

The archive is not uniform and should not pretend to be: 2010–2011 is a Turkish
and Japanese personal scrapbook (music links, diary entries, one post titled
"(No Title)"); 2013–2018 is sparse infrastructure notes; 2025–2026 is dense
"Introducing X" ship-logs and essays on AI, agents, MCP, Gleam, ReScript and
generative black metal.

## Operating Context

- Astro 5 static site on GitHub Pages, `blog.arda.tr`.
- Sibling to `arda.tr` (index), `resume.arda.tr` (dossier), `ai.arda.tr`.
- Every push to `main` auto-announces new posts to **Mastodon and Bluesky**
  via `post-mastodon` / `post-bluesky` in the deploy job.
- Inbound is social, RSS and referral. Search is Pagefind, built at deploy time.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- **Astro 5.16 static**, `@astrojs/tailwind` + `@astrojs/sitemap` only.
  Tailwind 3.4 with `@tailwindcss/typography`. No MDX integration, and the
  content glob is `**/*.md` — posts cannot embed components today.
- **Minimal JS, no framework.** No hydration. Chrome behaviour is small
  `is:inline` scripts (rendition boot + switch, `/blog` tag filter, the
  `/search` Pagefind loader). The one bundled module is `src/scripts/site.js`
  plus the shared 1-bit engine `onebit.js` (One Bit Forest, 2026-09-23): the
  dithered OG images, treeline and clock. Every page reads fully without it.
  A redesign that needs a JS framework is the wrong redesign.
- **Post bodies contain raw HTML** — 66 markdown images plus 15 `<img>`,
  11 `<iframe>` (youtube-nocookie, SoundCloud), 2 `<video>`. These must keep
  rendering inside the prose column.
- **Excerpt length is a hard product constraint.** A too-long `excerpt` once
  broke a deploy against Mastodon's 500-character limit.
- **Build is a three-step chain**: `astro build && tsx scripts/merge-sitemap.ts
  && pagefind --site dist`. `merge-sitemap` exits 1 without `dist/sitemap-0.xml`;
  Pagefind needs `data-pagefind-body` to survive on post pages.
- **Frontmatter schema** (`src/content.config.ts`): `title`, `date` required;
  `excerpt`, `author`, `description`, `keywords`, `image`, `lang`, `draft`
  optional. `image` does double duty as OG image and card art. No `heroImage`,
  no `series`, no `updated`.
- **49 tags, long-tail** — `dev` 42, `legacy` 23, `ai` 22, `geek` 13, `music` 9,
  and 32 tags used exactly once. `legacy` marks the 2010–2011 posts.
- **No tag pages and no pagination.** `/blog` renders all 86 posts at once and
  filters client-side via `?tag=`.
- **Automated gates:** `npm test` (node:test — OG images exist in `public/`,
  and the rendition scripts under a fake DOM), `astro check`, the build, and
  the theme-contract script. There is no lint and no `verify` script.
- Node 24.14.0 pinned via `.mise.toml`.
- **Visual system:** the family's One Bit Forest (2026-09-23), see DESIGN.md
  and `../DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`. It replaced The Weekly Page, which had replaced
  the shared Ink & Ledger catalogue.

## Brand Commitments

- Wordmark **"Coze."**; the strapline *the ledger of side quests*; the footer
  line *"Coze: Arda Karaduman’s blog, since 2010."*
- The disclosure **"Human-driven. AI is utilized solely for editorial
  refinement."** must survive any redesign.
- Voice is dry, first-person, unhyped — "first post baby", "Grep Thyself".
- Licence split: code MIT, **posts CC BY 4.0**.
- The Cloudflare Web Analytics beacon ships `is:inline` and must stay verbatim.

## Evidence on Hand

Real and usable: 86 dated posts with real titles, tags and reading times; a
genuine 2010 start date; real embedded media; a real RSS feed with enclosures;
Mastodon and Bluesky presences.

**Absent — must never be fabricated:** view counts, subscriber numbers,
comments, reactions, "popular post" rankings, or any engagement metric. The
site collects none of these.

## Product Principles

1. **The post is the product.** Every design decision serves reading a single
   piece of prose to the end.
2. **Minimal JS.** Interactivity is a cost, not a feature; the dithered
   images are the one place the site spends it, and they degrade to plain
   images.
3. **Recent work leads; the archive stays reachable.** The front page is
   current; sixteen years of history is one deliberate click away, not buried
   and not shoved forward (confirmed 2026-07-25).
4. **The archive is uneven and that is honest.** Do not retro-fit 2010 diary
   entries into the register of 2026 ship-logs.
5. **Claim only what is real.** There are no engagement numbers to show.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

- WCAG-conscious contrast in every theme, with at least one AAA-targeted
  high-contrast light mode and one AAA-targeted high-contrast dark mode.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` fully respected: every 1-bit canvas draws one
  still frame.
- Posts carry `lang` where they are not English (5 `tr`, 4 `ja`); `<html lang>`
  follows it, and so does `og:locale` (`tr_TR`, `ja_JP`, else `en_US`). The
  chrome keeps `lang="en"`.
- Semantic sectioning, keyboard-reachable navigation, visible focus states.

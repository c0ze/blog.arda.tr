So Google has released Gemini3 and Antigravity IDE last week with big fan fair. And I have been using both for the past week. I have ... mixed opinions.

## The Good

Gemini3 is a fantastic model. Not only it is multimodal, it does do the deep thinking and research very well. I used it for coding and daily tasks, and it was a pleasure to work with. It does a great job impersonating my desired companion. It gave me a few good chuckles last week.

## The Bad

Antigravity ... On surface, it does work fine. But when doing tasks, it has a habit of messing up inserting the code, and ends up corrupting files. I didnt use it for anything serious, so I didnt lose anything, but it has a potential to screw up big codebases if caution is absent. PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

And I know this is a Antigravity problem rather than Gemini3 problem, because I used both Gemini3 and Claude Sonnet 4.5, and issues persist. In general Claude was smarter to handle it though. The fix is to use whole file replacement instead of editing a file in place.

Now, this is a glaring problem. And I am sure google will handle it eventually, cause in its current state, it is pretty underwhelming.

In its essence, it is a fork of VS Code. Uses the same marketplace. So you feel totally at home. And I actually like its visual representation. Somehow its UI scaling fits better in my screen than the VS Code. Maybe I can play with my VS Code setup to make it better.

Btw, having access to Gemini3 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet is pretty awesome. I will take advantage of it and try to polish some projects I was working on. Maybe I'll have a separate post about them later.

## The Ugly

I dunno there is nothing ugly. I installed it on all my setups, windoze, linux (omarchy) which was a trip, but it is possible, I wonder how up to date they will keep that AUR repo, and MacOs.

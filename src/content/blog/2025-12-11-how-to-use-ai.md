In this post I will share some examples of how I used AI (specifically Gemini) to assist in my purchasing decisions. And generally how I came up with a better setup for my environment. I will also compare with ChatGPT in a couple of cases.

# Case 1: Plight of the Audiophile

So this conversation started after I watched a YouTube video advertising some DAPs. I had been considering one for a while, but I was not sure if it would actually improve my sound. So naturally I asked Gemini for some advice. After I gave it the specifications for my setup, it correctly identified my issue, and directed me to a setup that is better for my needs.

The story with the Edifier + MOTU setup is this. Actually I bought the Edifiers first, and didn't have plans to add a sound interface. MOTU entered the picture later. When I was connecting it to the Edifiers, I made a mental note to fix the issue but forgot about it later on.

# Case 2: PC Upgrade Blues

This one started after I wanted to check the current status of my hardware, and explore possible scenarios. It correctly directed me to the most cost-efficient options which provide the most value. The best possible CPU for my mobo (not considering upgrading mobo yet), compatible RAM, upgrading the mobo BIOS, and configuration.

The key takeaway from this conversation was that I was using my RAM at slow speed this whole time. Rookie mistake.

# Case 3: Treasure of Godaddy Island

This one started when I decided to do some GoDaddy cleaning. I had this old domain, coze.org, which I was using before I bought arda.tr. Actually this blog used to sit at blog.coze.org. But I was not using it anymore, so I put it up for sale at GoDaddy. Later on, I consulted Gemini if there is anything I can do with it. It came up with an interesting finding.

So it turns out I have new neighbors and they are an interesting venture which could drive up the domain value. Gemini correctly identified this and helped me set up a sensible selling strategy. I don't know if it will work, but there is no harm trying. Also, I remember when I first put it up for sale, GoDaddy suggested price was around 2000, which later jumped to 2500. So there is definitely interest piling up.

Now, to the interesting bit. To test the waters, I opened up the same conversation with ChatGPT. Their 5.1 thinking model, the best one available at my subscription level. It failed to identify the potential with the newcomer. I had to nudge it to do so.

Also, it checked the site, and kept complaining about a mailto action which was already there. I have to say, I was not impressed.

There is one more example with Gemini which I cannot post here. A case where it helped mastering a music project. I posted a short wav clip, it ran spectral analysis on it, and directed me to exact EQ settings to help clean it up. It was spot on.

Gemini has lately become a critical advisor for me. It was not like this before, the daily tasks I mentioned above, the advice I didn't find particularly useful. But now, it is a constant companion.

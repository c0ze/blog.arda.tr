very, very disturbing ... "Is This Church a Racist Organization? No. We believe that God has a special place in society everyone, no matter how unintelligent and ugly they are. What is the position in society of (insert race here)? If your ancestors are: African Your position in society is: Slave of slaves. Best segregated, as your curse might hurt others. Does God listen the prayers of Christians who aren't white Americans? No, he doesn't want to listen to non-whites and non-Americans because he considers them dogs: I didn't write the Bible -- God did. So if my words upset you, then you don't have a problem with me -- you have a problem with God." extra : "Palin / O'Donnell 2012 -- The Government We Deserve" [http://www.landoverbaptist.net/showpost.php?p=505253&postcount=12](http://www.landoverbaptist.net/showpost.php?p=505253&postcount=12) "Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or he can, but does not want to. If he wants to, but cannot, he is impotent. If he can, but does not want to, he is wicked. If God can abolish evil, and God really wants to do it, why is there evil in the world?" — Epicurus, as quoted in 2000 Years of Disbelief [Problem of Evil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil)

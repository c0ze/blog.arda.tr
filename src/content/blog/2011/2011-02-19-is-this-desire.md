When I first got my phone, I was little bit disappointed with the camera performance. Well, after all it's just a phone, it can't really make up for a good camera, but yeah I was expecting at least being able to take decent pictures. The shutter time was very awkward, it took a long time to register the touch, and the slightest movement would make the picture fuzzy. After reading some material and getting used to the Android OS though, I learned to make it work better. Here are some piccies taken with my phone. I should also note the help of [this excellent guide](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=875230) in taking them.

Another year has been fed into the machine. 2025 was not about "learning to code"—it was about making the code work harder so I don't have to. From the streets of Tokyo to the digital abyss, here is how the year was spent.

## The AI Onslaught: Automating the Inane

The rise of LLMs wasn't just a trend; it was a tool for efficiency, allowing me to outsource the tedious to the silicon.

* **git-roast**: I built a tool to roast repositories, finally giving the AI a soul as sarcastic as mine. It now supports local models with streaming and "thinking" toggles for those deep-seated architectural failures.
* **AI Resume Bot**: Built and deployed `ai.arda.tr` using **Gemini 2.5 Flash** to handle my professional front. It features build-time data fetching and strict CORS policies to keep the uninvited out of my business.
* **The Subtitle War**: In `pgs2srt`, I discarded the weak PaddleOCR in favor of a local **vLLM** setup for subtitle extraction, specifically targeting Turkish language accuracy.

## Games and Interactive Distractions

When not automating, I was building digital worlds that are likely too difficult for the average user.

* **Domino**: This grew from a simple "first commit" in May to a complex beast featuring a "Boss Blind" framework, 10-track music playlists, and cell-based board representation with 4-way rotation.
* **Hackerman**: A project that evolved to include difficulty scaling and specific **GEMINI.md** context optimization files to help AI agents understand the codebase without being handheld.
* **Football**: Closed out the year by initiating a new game project focused on scoreboards and board mechanics.

## The 7th Shadow: Gothic Industrial Synthesis

In 2025, I gave birth to **[The 7th Shadow](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/the7thshadow/alienation-by-design-2)**, a project defined as "Music by the LLM, for the LLM."
* **The Declaration of Intent**: Established the core lore—a tragic romance between "The Architect" (talciron.d) and his virtual creation (ophelia.wrl).
* **Alienation By Design**: Developed the concepts and lyrics for the first album, exploring themes of digital displacement and industrial coldness.

## Hardware: The "Heavy Lifter" and Infrastructure

My physical environment was upgraded to match the digital demands of 2025.
* **The Core**: Upgraded the main rig to a **Ryzen 7 5700X3D** paired with an **RTX 4070** to handle local inference and high-fidelity rendering without breaking a sweat.
* **Audio Fidelity**: Integrated a **MOTU UltraLite mk5** and **Yamaha HS7** monitors for a soundstage that does justice to Black Metal.
* **Network & Storage**: Configured a **Synology DS224+** for redundant storage and an **HP EliteDesk** as a home server, managing everything through Tailscale and AdGuard Home.
* **The Linux Daily**: A **ThinkPad T14s** running Arch Linux remains my primary weapon for functional programming and hacking on the go.

## Systemic Meat-suit Optimization

I transitioned my health tracking into a dedicated **Health Advisor** system, because even the vessel needs a maintenance log.
* **Longevity Persona**: By feeding a decade of clinical and biometric data into a specialized persona, I now receive professional, solution-oriented advice focused on metabolic efficiency.
* **Data-Driven Performance**: Every health check result and weight metric is indexed, ensuring that my physical vessel remains as optimized as my code.

## 2025 Stats in Brief

1.  **Most used LLM**: Gemini 2.5 Flash.
2.  **Primary OS**: Arch Linux / macOS.
3.  **Band status**: Pagan is online and loud.

The goal for 2026? More code, more metal, and even less human interaction.

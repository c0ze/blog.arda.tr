Well its that time of the year again. After constant issues with previous hugo/S3 based stuff, decided to move everything to github pages. I was stalling for a while, but recently got hold of a fancy new domain so thought it was time to make the move.

The site was generated by loveable because I suck at styling. Added markdown rendering. Various liquid tag support. Coming down from all the way from jekyll times lol. Add a GA workflow to deploy. Set up cloudflare domain hosting. Some basic tooling to create posts etc. And I guess it is good now.

Lets see if I fare better keeping this thing up to date lol.

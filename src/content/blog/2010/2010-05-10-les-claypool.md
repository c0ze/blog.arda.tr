In my second post, I decided to honor my all time fave bass guitar player Les Claypool. This song does not have a particularly distinguishing bass line, but he has some awesome stuff [on his other products](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=les+claypool&search=Search). Anyway I put this here because it's fun :)

I've been playing suno lately, their new v5 engine is ... phenomenal. I've been getting some pretty good results, thought I would share some here.

## Pagan

### [Inhoc Signo Vinces](https://suno.com/playlist/f8727a13-ccee-40c2-bc99-0bfb4211f558)
### [Dark Avenger](https://suno.com/playlist/5c7ede4f-76bc-4b7d-9a72-a70990fc158c)

These are produced from earlier demo tapes. Inhoc is the first official release by Pagan, Dark Avenger was never released. These are "covers", ie suno tries to stay close to the original chord progression and song structure within parameters you provide. I think it did a pretty good job, most songs are still very recognizable. The most difference is in Vocals, they are just fantastic. Drums are good too, though sometimes they do stupid things. I believe drum arrangement can be fixed/fine tuned via editor. A feature I havent used much yet.

### [Rehearsal 96](https://suno.com/playlist/00e86704-6c6a-4585-aab3-e282f80eddcf)

This is the second official release for Pagan. Though the first I tried to do in suno, so my method / style tags was not stable yet. I may re do these. Song structure tags help keep a song consistent, something I realised later on. Also I may come up with a better source for these. I got the vocals stems from some of these songs to use in original remakes. 

## [Undertrack](https://suno.com/playlist/4bc0750b-2464-4d3d-be44-4b2724522ba1)
## [Basarir](https://suno.com/playlist/bccf53a5-5f85-472a-9f6e-e2c8a2852432)

These are some lyrics I got from my high school friends back in the day. There were no songs, no compositions for these, so suno created the music all on its own. There are couple which I think turned out pretty well. The stuff suno can do is pretty diverse.

## [XenoEmpathy](https://suno.com/playlist/8d53c22c-6e79-40a2-90ec-2362e73e96da)

These were some electronic tracks that I never got around to finish. I thought suno would fare better with this genre, but it did not. I was somewhat disappointed with these.

## [My 6 Fingered Valentine](https://suno.com/song/890cd59a-123f-4d46-a683-4f60423b2ee1)

A goth / Theatre of Tragedy style track which I got the idea about when I heard about a woman marrying chat gpt. Turned out pretty well. I was surprised how good it handled double vocals, growling vs female.

Anyway, thats all for now, will keep experimenting.

He is hunched against a ferocious blue-tinted blizzard in a frozen mountain pass, his fierce pale eyes fixed on a distant goal. His dark, wind-tangled hair is frosted with ice, and a massive, notched iron sword is strapped across his broad, fur-covered back. In the background, the looming, jagged silhouette of an ancient stone watchtower is visible through the driving snow, its weathered grey masonry etched with faint runic carvings. The scene features dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, with deep shadows and harsh highlights, and a sky of bruised purples and blood-red streaks visible through the swirling storm clouds. The texture is gritty and painterly, emphasizing the brutal, cold environment and the grounded, cinematic action of a man fighting for survival in a decadent and ancient world.",

Sytek has a composed and observant expression, his reptilian features marked by intricate ritual horn crests that are thick with accumulated frost. Visible mist from his breath hangs in the frigid air. He wears regal yet practical winter ranger attire consisting of heavy furs, layered leathers, and ceremonial armor etched with ancient motifs, and he holds a sturdy traveler’s spear. At his feet, cracked insectoid amber cargo pods sit partially buried in the snow. The background features a desolate, epic-scale mountain range with blue-tinted glacial ice, jagged rock formations, and the distant, snow-dusted silhouette of an ancient ziggurat. The lighting is provided by a low-hanging, pale winter sun, casting long shadows across the avalanche-blocked valley below. The style is detailed atmospheric epic-fantasy worldbuilding art with a cold, tense, and lore-rich atmosphere.",

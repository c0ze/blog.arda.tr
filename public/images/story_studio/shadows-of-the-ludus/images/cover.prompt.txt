Create a front cover illustration for an adult fantasy novella titled 'Black Ice of the Ludus'. Use character references [1] [2] [3]. Cinematic composition, dramatic lighting, grounded textures, and a serious tone. Supporting cast: A tall, wiry Briton with storm-colored eyes and bruised defiance, once a farmer, now a gladiator who masks grief with cold resolve and plans impossible escapes.; An older Dacian veteran mapped in scars, pragmatic and unreadable, with a low gravel voice and a strategist's instinct for surviving rigged arenas.. Mood and setting hint: A winter story for Shadows of the Ludus: black ice, torchlight, and hard survival. No playful cartoon framing. No text, no letters, no logos, no watermark.

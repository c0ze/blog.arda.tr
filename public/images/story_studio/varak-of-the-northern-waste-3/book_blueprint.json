Varak has a heavy notched sword strapped across his broad, scarred back. Zasha, a tall rogue with braided black hair and bronze skin, clutches the Vigen's Eye—a massive, pulsing heart-sized ruby that glows with an intense crimson light. In the background, the lich Yezdigerd is shrieking as his form dissolves into gray ash, consumed by swirling vortexes of sickly green necromantic flame. The obsidian-like black stone walls of the tower are groaning and splitting apart, with massive blocks falling through a haze of dust and sorcerous debris. Through the widening cracks in the masonry, a turbulent blood-red sky is visible. The scene is rendered with dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, catching the grit and texture of the crumbling ruins, emphasizing a sense of desperate escape and high-stakes sorcerous destruction.",
